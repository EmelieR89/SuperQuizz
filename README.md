# SuperQuizz
Game we made as a project in school. 
In this game you take a guess at a randomly generated number between 1-100. After you have guessed, the game leader instructs you to either
go higher or lower. You will get to choose how many bots you want to play against. One of the players is randomly chosen to start answering. All the current players previous answers will be shown as a list. Who ever guesses the right number first wins.
